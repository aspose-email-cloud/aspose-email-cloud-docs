Now you can use artificial intelligence functionality for creating email applications that work with standard email file formats. There are two ways to parse business cards using the Business card recognition API – with cloud storage or not.
### **2. Name API for parsing and handling personal names**
This is a modern approach, which provides you numerous useful functions to process names:

- Parse name of a person into parts (First name, Surname, etc.).
- Process the name of a person to determine the gender.
- Format a person’s name using a specific format.
- Compare a list of names to determine whether they belong to the same person.
- Expand a person's name into a list of possible alternatives
- Get several different names, starting with certain letters.
- Parse out person's name from an email address.
- See AI features usage tutorials for all supported SDKs: [Name API](/email/name-api/) and [Business card recognition](/email/business-cards-recognition/).
