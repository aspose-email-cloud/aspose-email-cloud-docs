## **Introduction**
[**Aspose.Email Cloud**](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) allows you to work with **contact cards**. Let us guide you throughout working with business cards.
### **About VCard**
**VCard** or **VCF** (Virtual Contact File) is a file format for exchanging electronic business cards. VCard file contains records of VCard type, each having the information from one business card. VCard record can include an address, name, logo, phone numbers, URL, video and audio fragments, etc. 

VCards can be exchanged in many ways, such as MMS, World Wide Web, attached to e-mail messages, through QR code or instant messaging. VCard is used as a data interchange format in customer relationship management (CRMs), personal digital assistants (PDAs) and personal information managers (PIMs). 

Usually, VCard is used to quickly add a person to your contacts. When you import the data from a VCard file, you import the data from the fields into matching fields in a new contact record. You can see this process when you receive a message with a person’s VCard in it. When you click on the VCard - the person's information is imported into your contacts. 

VCards allows to make it easier for people to add contact information into their contacts. It is also possible to add VCard to your email’s signature. 

Also, you can process multiple VCard files. You can import or export multiple contacts into one file. 

[**Aspose.Email Cloud API**](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) allows to work with VCard files in your applications. Using the cloud approach helps to increase the processing speed of the applications, that are developed with Aspose.Email Cloud.


### **VCard With Aspose.Email Cloud API**
[Aspose.Email Cloud API](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) allows processing **contact cards (VCard)** files in your way. With this API you can easily create, update, save, and manage **VCard** files.

We provide you with [artificial intelligence Business Card Scanner](https://wiki.lutsk.dynabic.com/Aspose%20Email/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud%20-%20Documentation%20improvements/Getting%20started/1.%20Overview/1.%20Key%20features%20/BCR/), using it you can immediately convert the image of a business card to the contact card file for further processing.

## **How to Start Working With Contact Card Files**
### **Setup Aspose.Email Cloud SDK**
Let’s start with setting up [Aspose.Email Cloud SDK](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family). Read more: [**SDK setup**](/email/sdk-setup/).

Please check that everything is working fine before going ahead.
### **Work With Contact Card Files via MAPI**
[Aspose.Email Cloud API](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) supports **MAPI**. Please, read more: [**Working with MAPI**](/email/working-with-mapi/).

You are able to work with [Aspose.Email Cloud API](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) via MAPI to process email messages, **contact cards** and calendars your way. This approach can help you to unify your file processing with [**Aspose Storage**](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages).


## **Work With Contact Card in Aspose.Email Cloud**
[Aspose.Email Cloud API](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) provides you with 2 ways for working with contact card (VCard) files.
### **Operate VCard Using Model API**
The first way — operate contact card (VCard) files using **Model API**. 

Model API provides you with a simple way to work with email’s data. You can process contact cards using numerous useful functions.

Also, using this approach allows you to scan any of the business cards and convert them to VCard files for further processing using our technology [**AI Business Card Scanner**](https://wiki.lutsk.dynabic.com/Aspose%20Email/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud%20-%20Documentation%20improvements/Getting%20started/1.%20Overview/1.%20Key%20features%20/BCR/).

VCard **Model API** supports to:

- Get VCard file from storage as ContactDto type with [**GetContactModel**](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-dotnet/blob/master/docs/EmailApi.md#GetContactModel) method.
- Save ContactDto object to Storage with [**SaveContactModel**](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-dotnet/blob/master/docs/EmailApi.md#SaveContactModel) method.
- Get a list of VCard files from Storage folder with [**GetContactModelList**](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-dotnet/blob/master/docs/EmailApi.md#GetContactModelList) method.
- Recognize VCard from image to ContactDto type with [**AI Business Card Recognition**](https://wiki.lutsk.dynabic.com/Aspose%20Email/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud%20-%20Documentation%20improvements/Getting%20started/1.%20Overview/1.%20Key%20features%20/BCR/) functionality[ ](https://wiki.lutsk.dynabic.com/Aspose%20Email/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud%20-%20Documentation%20improvements/Getting%20started/1.%20Overview/1.%20Key%20features%20/BCR/)([AiBcrParseModel](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-dotnet/blob/master/docs/EmailApi.md#AiBcrParseModel)).

### **Operate VCard Using Property Sets**
The second way — operating contact card (VCard) files as property sets. Find an example here: [Read Contact Document Properties](/email/read-contact-document-properties/).

Working with VCard files as **property sets is an outdated approach**. We advise you to **use Model API**, because of it’s convenience and usability.

## **Setup Aspose.Email Cloud SDK**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project.
