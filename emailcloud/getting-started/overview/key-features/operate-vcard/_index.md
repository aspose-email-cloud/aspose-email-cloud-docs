## **Work With Contact Cards in Aspose.Email Cloud**
Use Aspose.Email Cloud to create powerful applications. Cloud approach allows you to develop multi-purpose applications.

With [**Aspose.Email Cloud**](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) you can:

1. Work with contact card (VCard) files on [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages): create, edit [VCF](https://wiki.fileformat.com/email/vcf/) files, work with VCards, download & upload contact card files, update and remove contact card files’ properties.
1. Parse an image of business cards to contact card files further processing. Aspose.Email Cloud API provides you with an artificial intelligence approach called [**AI Business Card Recognition](https://wiki.lutsk.dynabic.com/Aspose%20Email/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud%20-%20Documentation%20improvements/Getting%20started/1.%20Overview/1.%20Key%20features%20/BCR/)**.** 
1. Attach a contact card file ([VCF](https://wiki.fileformat.com/email/vcf/)) to an email and send it using our build-in [Email Client](/emailcloud/email-client/)[.](http://client/)



Now, it’s time to talk about **how to work with contact card files**.

[Aspose.Email Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) allows to operate with **contact card (VCard)** files in 2 ways:
### **Work With VCard File as Model API**
The first way — **use Model API** to process contact cards.

**Model API** provides you with a better way to work with **contact card files**, calendars and emails.

In **Model API** contact card files are represented using models, which helps to make the applications’ development easier.

**VCard Model API** supports to:

- **Get contact card file** from [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages).
- **Save contact card file** to [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages).
- **Get a list of contact card files** from [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages).
- **Recognize contact card from image to VCard** file with [**AI Business Card Recognition**](https://wiki.lutsk.dynabic.com/Aspose%20Email/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud/Aspose.Email%20for%20Cloud%20-%20Documentation%20improvements/Getting%20started/1.%20Overview/1.%20Key%20features%20/BCR/) functionality.
### **Work With VCard File as Property Sets**
The second way is operating files as property sets. Find an example here: [**Read Contact Document Properties**](/emailcloud/read-contact-document-properties/).

**Note:** Using Model API is a more productive, convenient and useful approach.
