## **About iCalendar**
**iCalendar** allows users to exchange & store scheduling information or journal entries, events, to-dos, etc.

iCalendar files are stored as [ICS](https://wiki.fileformat.com/email/ics/) file on the [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages). With Aspose.Email Cloud API you are able to create the software with the cloud approach that helps to process all your data on the cloud immediately. Using our API you can speed up the work of your applications. Add iCalendar support to your applications or create software, such as multi-purpose email readers or applications to work with calendars. Make it easier for recipients of calendar data files to work with them.



iCalendar is a file format which is using all around the world. Many popular products support it, including Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar, IBM Notes or Lotus Notes, Google Calendar and many more. Integrate with these applications using [**Aspose.Email Cloud**](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family).

Below we will talk about how to work with **calendar files**, which are also called like **iCalendar** or **ICS.**

[Aspose.Email Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) allows to operate with iCalendar files in 2 ways:
### **Work With iCalendar File as Model API**
**Model API** provides you with a better way to work with **calendars**, contact cards and emails.

In **Model API** calendar files are represented using models.

iCalendar Model API supports to:

- **Get a calendar** file from [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages).
- **Save a calendar** file on [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages).
- **Get a list of calendar files** from [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages) folder.
- **Get a calendar** file from [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages) **as AlternateView type**. 
- **Convert a calendar file to AlternateView**. A calendar file which is converted to AlternateView can be appended to the email.
### **Work With iCalendar File as Property Set**
The second way is to operate a calendar file as a property set. For example, to create a **calendar** file using the property set: **[Create iCalendar file using the property set](/emailcloud/create-icalendar-file-using-the-property-set/)**.

**Note:** Using Model API is a more convenient and productive approach.
