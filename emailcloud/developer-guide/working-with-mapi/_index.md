## **Introduction**
[**Aspose.Email Cloud**](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) supports **MAPI**. Let us guide you throughout the working with MAPI.
### **About MAPI**
MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) - is a proprietary API, which allows working with various electronic messaging systems. MAPI is based on the COM model, as well as a software messaging interface from Microsoft. MAPI allows you to access mailboxes through Outlook and other MAPI mail clients to receive, read, create, send messages, attach files to them, access the attached files, etc.

MAPI is based on the X.400 XAPIA standard. It provides facilities to access message stores, message transports and directories.

There are two versions of MAPI. Simple MAPI (SMAPI) allows developers to implement and work with basic messaging functionality. Another version is an Extended MAPI (EMAPI), which enables a complete control over the messaging system on the user’s computer. EMAPI helps to manage and create messages and manage the client mailbox.

Simple MAPI is used with Microsoft Windows as a part of Outlook Express/Windows Mail. The Extended MAPI is included in Exchange and Office Outlook.


### **MAPI with Aspose.Email Cloud API**
**MAPI** allows working with various electronic messaging systems. [Aspose.Email Cloud API](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) allows you to use **MAPI** to create documents, get or update document properties, add & delete attachments from the document.

By using this approach you can speed up your applications and manipulate with numerous files via our servers at the same time - the processing load is transferred from your system to ours.

## **Benefits of Using Mapi With Aspose.Email Cloud API**
MAPI provides a universal way to work with different files such as email messages, contact cards and calendars.
### **Working With Email Messages via MAPI**
1. Work with your files on the [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages) via MAPI: create, update, add/edit attachments and download email message files.
1. Convert MAPI email message files to [**EML**](https://wiki.fileformat.com/email/eml/), [**HTML**](https://wiki.fileformat.com/web/html/) or [**MHTML**](https://wiki.fileformat.com/web/mhtml/) and vice versa.
1. Send MAPI messages via our internal [Email Client](/email-client/). To send a message you just need to convert a MAPI file to Base64 string or pass a file’s path in the [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages) to the internal [Email Client](/email-client/). After that built-in [Email Client](/email-client/) will be able to send it or add it to your email client’s account as an email message.

[Aspose.Email Cloud API](https://products.aspose.cloud/email/family) provides numerous useful functions and classes for 
comfortable working. Therefore, you can get an email message instantly as an **EmailDto,** which is convenient to work 
with and which is supported by our internal [**Email Client**](/email-client/) and 
[**EmailModel API**](/working-with-new-model-api/).

### **Working With Contact Card Files via MAPI**
Aspose.Email Cloud API provides a lot of useful functions for working with VCard files: create, edit, update and save contact card files. Read more: [**Working with Contact Cards**](/working-with-contact-cards/).

You can get a contact file from the [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages) as a **ContactDto** via MAPI, then edit contact files and instantly save it back to the [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages) as an MAPI file or as a VCard. This can be helpful when you work with a big number of contact card files. 

With Aspose.Email Cloud API you can easily **scan images of business cards,** work with scanned business cards as VCard files. Read more: [**Business Card Recognition API**](/business-cards-recognition-api/).

### **Working With Calendars via MAPI**
MAPI allows working with calendars too. You can easily process calendar (iCalendar) files with Aspose.Email Cloud API: 

- Create, save and edit iCalendar files on the [Storage](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/storages). To work with MAPI files you need to convert them to **CalendarDto**. 
- Work with calendar files’ attachments: edit them, search through them and more.
- Convert iCalendar files to an Alternate View[](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-dotnet/blob/master/docs/AlternateView.md)**.**

### **Working With MAPI Files via Built-In Email Client**
The best in using MAPI with Aspose.Email Cloud API is that you can send MAPI files via our built-in [**Email Client**](/email-client/). 

Aspose.Email Cloud API has a built-in Email Client which allows to:

- Send emails.

## **Setup Aspose.Email Cloud SDK**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project.
