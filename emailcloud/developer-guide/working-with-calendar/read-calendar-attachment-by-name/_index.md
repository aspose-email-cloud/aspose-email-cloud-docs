## **Setup Aspose.Email Cloud SDK**
Using an SDK (API client) is the quickest way for a developer to speed up the development. An SDK takes care of a lot of low-level details of making requests and handling responses and lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project. Checkout our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud) for a complete list of Aspose.Email SDKs along with working examples.
